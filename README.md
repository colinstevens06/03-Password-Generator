# 03-Password-Generator
Password generator using javascript

This was the most challenging lesson so far (duh, right?). I honestly wasn't sure if I was going to be able to do it, but I had a dedicated night to kickoff this assignment and I made serious progress in just a few hours.

## Pseudo Pseudo Pseduo Code... ooohhhh OOHHHHH
Sing it to Phill Collins' Sussudio and it feels so right.

Pseudocoding is what got me through this assignment.

I was struggling figuring out where to even start with this so I turned to a copywriting writer's block trick where you just start typing stream of consciousness to get started. so I started pseudocoding stream of consciousness. It helped so much. I feel like it was a ton of pseudocoding but who cares - it got me where I needed to go.

So once I figured out what I needed to do, I started looking back at previous lessons and searching Google for the answers to my issues.

## Breakthroughs

I had a few breakthroughs with my coding during the prep leading up to this assignment. After Week 1 of Javascript, I spent the majority of my learning time focusing on the JavaScript basics. I nearly finished the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript course in a weekend. That helped a lot - just getting the basics and setting a good foundation.

Then it started to make sense along with Stetson's outline for good Javascript in class. Start by declaring all the variables, then write your functions, then run your functions.

## Random Password

My first night working on this was the pseudocoding and writing the script for the random password. I just put fingers to keyboards and started writing code and it all kind of came together. I had an idea to run random numbers to pick off of a string, and that string to be built based off of user responses for questions. Honestly, I was super freaking pumped when I was logging the random password to the console

## Tying the Password into the page
Once I got the HTML file setup w/ the right IDs (I used the starter file provided and added a few elements), I didn't find it that hard to edit the CSS. More challenging was getting the random password to display on the screen.... but I tried to use computer thinking and really walk through my eventListener and say 'when this thing happens, what needs to happen next.' then i got everything in the right order in my eventlistener and it all worked.

## Improvements
I know this could be better from a UI standpoint. Hoping to have more time Sunday to really make this sing, but I'm pretty happy that I could generate a random password and have it display on the screen.
